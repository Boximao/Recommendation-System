This project is about building a recommendation system that uses user information (reviews, likes, followers, etc.) 
and business information (location, price, parking availibility, ratings, etc) to predict what a  user would rate a
business, thus knowing which business to recommend.

The final model is a hybrid recommendation model using a combination of item-based collaberative filter and a model-
based recommendation system. Python is used for this project, and PySpark is implemented for faster performance on 
large-scale data.

The final result of this recommendation system gives an RMSE of 0.971, ranking top 20% in the competition.
